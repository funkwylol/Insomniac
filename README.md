# README

Hello! If you are reading this you most likely downloaded the open source, or you are snooping around. (sneaky little boy hehe)

I please ask you to give credit to my code if you use it in your projects, i give full permission to use code examples from my project, however please do not copy my entire project, as I have spent lots of time, and eventually money on it.

# DOCUMENTATION

I dont have documentation quite yet, but all i have to say is that the things to work around the code and understand it, are written in comments in the code.
